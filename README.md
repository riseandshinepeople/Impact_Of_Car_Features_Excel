# Impact Of Car Features 
Project description	:	Project is all about how can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand															
This problem could be approached by analysing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing.

Approach:	The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP".															
First,I have cleaned the data and then used co-relation and regression analysis to find relation between all variables.			
 
Tech stack used	:	Power BI and Microsoft excel	

Data Cleaning:I have cleaned the car data by removing the duplicates from the remove duplicate section of data tab and then removed all Blank values from find and select option in ribbon from the home button in tool bar.

Inference:
Maximum count of model is in crossover and min count is for Crossover,Exotic,Luxury,Performance.		
Cars with high city mpg and highway mpg are made more in 2014 to 2016.
The maximum value of horse power is when MSRP in between 1500000 and 2000000 and maximum cars is in between 405-605 horsepower range 
and MSRP around 500000.

Regression Analysis:

The R squared value of Engine horsepower is maximum .It proves that out of all the variables "Engine HP" has maximum depedency (42%) on MSRP.The regression analysis of different car features and prices show that Engine HP and car price are highly correlated and have a high determination coefficient. This feature can be used to predict car price	.							
								
The r value for engine HP is 0.6 (near to 1) so,strong positive co-relation.		
		
INFERENCE	:

As,seen from graph the dataset has negative slope and positive intercept and correlation coeffecient is negative means there is negative co-relation andincrease in one variable lead to decrease in other.		
		
As,value of r(pearson coeffecient) is near to -0.61471 ,that shows strong negative correlation between variables.		
		
More the fuel effeciency less is the requirement of Cylinders.		

Conclusion:

1. The vehicle styles – 2dr, 4dr hatchbacks, sedan, wagon, passenger van, convertible are popular over the years and have lower prices.
2. The popular features are Flex-fuel, Direct Drive, Four wheel drive and popular market categories Flex fuel, SUV, Factory tuner, Diesel, Hybrid suggest involving sustainable technology in the cars.
3. But the popular vehicle styles do not have these features.
4. In order to increase the popularity of these features the manufactures should focus on product development using the features mentioned above.
5. The Engine HP is directly related to the car prices more than the other features.
6. We do not have the data of profitability or manufacturing cost of the cars and the features, hence the optimized price and right features to focus during product development could not be determined
